		-- All statements within the block must be indented the same amount

--:: Comments
		-- Comments start with a # (One Line)

--:: Docstrings
		-- Python also has extended documentation capability, called docstrings.
		-- Docstrings can be one line, or multiline.
		-- Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring

--:: Multiple Statements on a Single Line
		-- The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line

--:: Python Variables :- Reserved memory locations to store values

--:: To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:

x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)
